# Kuromi Kards
Kuromi kards is an online memory game, flip cards to remember their positions and match them up in as few flips as possible

![Site Preview](https://i.imgur.com/GcEDbkS.png)

## Features
The page opens with a game ready to play, with a score system built in, the less cards you flip to get a match, the more points you score!
The website has a responsive design.

## Bugs
- Ocassionally on a match, it wont register. (Currently unable to reproduce)
- ~~On Deployment to GitHub Pages, sometimes one image will 404 for an unknown reason.~~ Fixed! There was a typo in the file name kuromIFour.png vs kuromiFour.png

## Design
- I opted to not use flexboxes in this design as it is a relatively simple page not requiring much positioning
- Styled using the colour scheme of Kuromi 
- I also used images of Kuromi for the cards to keep consistent with the theme
